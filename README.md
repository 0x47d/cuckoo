UPDATE: Dave Anderson proposed an alternative algorithm on his blog

  http://da-data.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-public-review-of-cuckoo-cycle.html

that uses about (1/64+1/K) times the memory at O(K) times slowdown.
The slowdown is actually very minor; a little over 2 times at K=64.
I re-implemented this "tomato" (his pronouncable spelling of tmto,
or time-memory trade-off) in branch "dave". Right now it only does
edge reduction. Interfacing to the old algorithm for cycle finding
is non-trivial and needs some more thought. That will become the new
reference implementation, while the old one will remain as a somehwat
faster memory-waster.

Cuckoo Cycle remains tmto-hard if using less than one bit per nonce causes
a 100x or more slowdown. I offer a $1000 bounty for a hardness disproving
implementation.

The README in branch dave updates items 1), 6), and 7) below.

cuckoo
======

Mining is generally considered to be inherently power hungry but it need not be.
Itâ€™s a consequence of making the proof of work computationally intensive.
If computation is minimized in favor of random access to gigabytes of memory
(incurring long latencies), then mining will require large investments in RAM
but relatively little power.

Cuckoo Cycle represents a breakthrough in three important ways:

1) it performs only one very cheap siphash computation for about 3.3 random accesses to memory,

2) its memory requirement can be set arbitrarily

3) verification of the proof of work is instant, requiring 2 sha256 and 42 siphash computations.

Runtime in Cuckoo Cycle is completely dominated by memory latency. It promotes the use
of commodity general-purpose hardware over custom designed single-purpose hardware.

Other features:

4) proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle in the Cuckoo graph.

5) it has a natural notion of (base) difficulty, namely the number of edges in the graph;
   above about 60% of size, a 42-cycle is almost guaranteed, but below 50% the probability
   starts to fall sharply.

6) running time for the current implementation on high end x86 is under 24s/GB single-threaded,
   and under 3s/GB for 12 threads.

7) making cuckoo use a significant fraction of the typical memory of a botnet computer
   will send it into swap-hell, and likely alert its owner.
