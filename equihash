Finally, we mention schemes Momentum [21] and Cuckoo
cycle [32], which provide fast verification due to their combi-
natorial nature. They rely on the memory requirements for the
collision search (Momentum) or graph cycle finding (Cuckoo).
However, Momentum is vulnerable to a sublinear time-space
tradeoff [11], whereas the first version of the Cuckoo scheme
was recently broken in [6].
